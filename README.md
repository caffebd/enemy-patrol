title: Enemy Patrol Extension
---


## Usage

This extensions adds blocks in sprites to quickly implement and enemy patrol route. Give your enemy sprite an x or y velocity and then use the enemy patrol blocks to set a maximum distance to move before reversing direction.

Useful for platform games or RPG games where you don't simply want the enemy to bounce on the edge of the screen or off a wall.

The blocks are added to the bottom of the **sprites** toolbox.
